# Breast Cancer Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains medical information related to breast cancer cases. It includes data derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass, with features that describe the characteristics of cell nuclei. The dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks to predict whether a tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of 32 columns, with the following key features:

- **`id`**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **`diagnosis`**: The diagnosis of breast tissues (M = malignant, B = benign).
- **`radius_mean`**, **`texture_mean`**, **`perimeter_mean`**, **`area_mean`**, **`smoothness_mean`**, **`compactness_mean`**, **`concavity_mean`**, **`concave points_mean`**, **`symmetry_mean`**, **`fractal_dimension_mean`**: Mean values of various cell nucleus features.
- **`radius_se`**, **`texture_se`**, **`perimeter_se`**, **`area_se`**, **`smoothness_se`**, **`compactness_se`**, **`concavity_se`**, **`concave points_se`**, **`symmetry_se`**, **`fractal_dimension_se`**: Standard error values of these features.
- **`radius_worst`**, **`texture_worst`**, **`perimeter_worst`**, **`area_worst`**, **`smoothness_worst`**, **`compactness_worst`**, **`concavity_worst`**, **`concave points_worst`**, **`symmetry_worst`**, **`fractal_dimension_worst`**: Worst (largest) values of these features.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for training machine learning models to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign based on the provided features. It is particularly useful for testing classification algorithms and improving diagnostic accuracy.
